# FlashCards Application

As a fully functional studying application, Quizler allows users to create decks of flashcards, fill those decks with flashcards, and add tags to their own cards allowing the user (and others) to search for the respective cards & decks. Users can submit their decks for public use to the overall community of users therefore allowing others the ability to add cards they deem viable to their own decks. 

Users can perform a study session on a specific flashcard deck, including all public decks. Study Session features include a preset order, randomized order, and a customizable, timed lightning round. 

In addition to text-based cards, users also have the option of customizing deck color, text color, and even creating image based cards. 

Developed in an agile environment, we used C# within an `ASP.NET` MVC application with an MSSQL server backend, and styled the frontend with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The application uses an MVC API Controller for dynamic features such as live search.
